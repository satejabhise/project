<p2><font color="cornflowerblue">Having a blogging niche is very important because it means there is more clarity about what content you are going to make, and there is more clarity for 
your regular readers about what sort of content they will be reading. If they enjoy your niche and your content based on that niche, they will most likely tune in regularly. If they cannnot 
see a particular subject you are writing about and don't know what to expect, some will stay because they trust your writing and planning skills, however some might stop reading your blog, 
and that will decrease your readership and (if you are making money) how much you make.</font></p2>

<h2><font color="cornflowerblue">So how do you pick a niche?</font></h2>
<p3><font color="cornflowerblue">On this website I have only listed a few possible niches that make a lot of money. I recommend visiting <font color="hotpink">Finding your niche</font>
 and if there is one you are good at or you think you can manage, then go for it! However, if you don't see any you can try, then do some more research into it. I think just taking your
 talent and running wiht it can a be a bit of a gamble, so if that is what you are planning on, don't go too fancy. For more blogging tips, visit <font color="hotpink">Other tips & tricks

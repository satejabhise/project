<h2><font color="cornflowerblue">Having a style of writing</font></h2>
<p2><font color="cornflowerblue">Having good content is just as important as having a good niche. Your readers amy not want to read your blog if the language used in your blog isn't very 
descriptive. You could have a great topic and niche for writing, but if the way you talk about it doesn't appeal to the reader or doesn't make sense, they probably won't read to the end.
A good way of preventing this is knowing your target audience. This could be determined by age group, profession, hobbies, anything really! For example, my target audience right now is people
 wishing to start a blog. If you know who you want to get the message accross to, it will helpful to determine what language to use, and how much to write (also how many emojis to use!)</font></p2>
<br><br>
<h2><font color="cornflowerblue">Design & style </font></h2>
<p3><font color="cornflowerblue">Having a clean design is almost as important as the content of your blog. If you have a clean, clear design, your readers will know where to find things, 
and also how to navigate your page. One way of making sure they know where they're going is by making a menu bar/block. It helps them navigate your page and also separates the header content off
 from the actual posts and design.</font></p3>
<h3><font color="cornflowerblue">Be interactive!</font></h3>
<p4><font color="cornflowerblue">What this means is that, whichever blogging platform you use, it is guaranteed there will be other bloggers on there. If you try and find some blogs you like on that 
platform and interact with them, it lays a foundation for your blog to grow more along with theirs. You can also find inspiration for your own blog, you can collab with other bloggers,
 and you can also find hundreds of other blogs you like to read! You can make some very close friends through blogging, so take advantage of it!</font></p4>

<p5><font color="cornflowerblue"> That's all the tips I have, I hope you have evry success with your blog! One last tip: your readers won't want to read something that has been written 
solely for the purpose of making money from it. Make sure you write froom the heart and have fun doing it!</font></p5>
